# 3DOpenGLGame
 A project where I learn to use OpenGL to create a simple 3D "game".
 This project was run on a m1(ARM) based mac, so it is not guaranteed to run on intel-based machines.
 This project also uses CMake to build the project files, edited in both VS Code and CLion, hence the existence of the folders .idea and .vscode.
 
## Features
- Move around using the W, A, S, D keys and rotate the camera by using the comma and period keys

- Basic diffuse lighting

- Load models with obj files (with faces of only three vertices)
